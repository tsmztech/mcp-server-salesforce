## Setup

### Salesforce Authentication
You can connect to Salesforce using one of two authentication methods:

#### 1. Username/Password Authentication (Default)
1. Set up your Salesforce credentials
2. Get your security token (Reset from Salesforce Settings)

#### 2. OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow
1. Create a Connected App in Salesforce
2. Enable OAuth settings and select "Client Credentials Flow"
3. Set appropriate scopes (typically "api" is sufficient)
4. Save the Client ID and Client Secret
5. **Important**: Note your instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.my.salesforce.com`) as it's required for authentication

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### For Username/Password Authentication:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@simon/mcp-server-salesforce"],
      "env": {
        "SALESFORCE_CONNECTION_TYPE": "User_Password",
        "SALESFORCE_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "SALESFORCE_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "SALESFORCE_TOKEN": "your_security_token",
        "SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL": "org_url"        // Optional. Default value: https://login.salesforce.com
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@simon/mcp-server-salesforce"],
      "env": {
        "SALESFORCE_CONNECTION_TYPE": "OAuth_2.0_Client_Credentials",
        "SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL": "https://your-domain.my.salesforce.com"  // REQUIRED: Must be your exact Salesforce instance URL
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: For OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow, the `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL` must be your exact Salesforce instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.my.salesforce.com`). The token endpoint will be constructed as `<instance_url>/services/oauth2/token`.
